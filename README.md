## Code Snippets

- Install `node-sass`

It is easy to fail to install in China in the normal way. Can be installed in the following ways:

```
npm i -D node-sass --sass_binary_site=https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/node-sass/
```

## Other

The reason this repository exists is because gistub's gist cannot be accessed in the normal way.
